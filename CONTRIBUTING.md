# Contributing

First of all, thank you for considering to contribute to this repository.

## Rules
1. Keep it simple
2. Keep it clear
3. Limit your AI use

   It's hard to deny it, AI is handy, but do **NOT** use it for everything. You can use it to learn, understand and get rid of repetitive tasks, but pull requests that are clearly made with AI without even checking if they work correctly won't be accepted. It's much better to make a human mistake than to waste maintainers' time on something someone didn't put effort into.
   
4. Don't add random features
   
   Is there a bug? Absolutely go ahead and fix it, you are more than welcome!

   Do you think that this project should have a feature? If it makes substantial changes to the codebase then it's better to ask first in issues, most of the time large features are not within the scope of this project.

5. Test before submitting (within reason ofc)

## Project scope
This project intentionally stays small and focused.Not every good idea is a good fit here, and that’s okay.

If a feature significantly expands the scope, it will likely be rejected unless discussed beforehand.

You are free to take parts of this project to include in your own. We appreciate credits.
